            <h2>2. Estimations [5 mins]</h2>
            <p>
                Estimations are essential in the system design of a ticket management system as they help predict the required resources, such as network bandwidth, storage, and processing power, to handle expected ticket volumes. Accurate estimations ensure the system is designed to meet demand efficiently, preventing bottlenecks and ensuring smooth performance during peak times.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Assume <strong>100K daily active users</strong> and <strong>500-1,000</strong> events at any given time during peak periods.</li>
                <li>Storage required per user is <strong>1 MB</strong>, so for <strong>100K users</strong>, it totals <strong>1 TB</strong> for user profiles.</li>
                <li>With <strong>1K</strong> ticket purchases per second, the system would need approximately <strong>100 TB</strong> for <strong>1 million events</strong>, each with <strong>100K tickets</strong>.</li>
